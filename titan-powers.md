# Titan Powers

**Titan Shifters and Powers**

In our humble nation, Hydrian Heights, there are very special people known as “Titan Shifters.” These people possess the powers of turning into Titans, towering monsters with special abilities of their own. There are 5 Titans that exist, and they are called:

1. The Female Titan
2. The Ironclad Titan
3. The Blitz Titan
4. The Numen Titan
5. The Phantom Titan

Each Titan is passed down between the royal family and their bodyguards. The Titans were created for our protection and safety. The Power of The Titans came from The Colossus, the very first enderman to succumb to the abhorrent act of cannibalism. When he had stumbled across the Chorus Fruit Forest, the energy of The End dimension packed into the Chorus Fruit shocked his brain, reforming his logical thinking nerves, and gave him a newfound power: Titan Shifting. After 9 years of creating the 5 Titans, he had excitedly ran off to tell his mates, but was devoured by 5 Endermen, hypnotized by the way of eating each other.

The Colossus’ powers were then split among the 5 endermen that ate him, resulting in the 5 Titans that we have today. Titan Shifting is an act of inflicting damage unto oneself, whilst having a clear goal in mind. Upon the blood becoming airborne, a purple bolt of lightning will shoot down from above, forming the bones, flesh and skin of the Titan. Each Titan Shifter has its own unique abilities.

**TITAN SHIFTERS AND USERS EXPLAINED BELOW.**

**The Female Titan**

This Titan is taken on by the Queen of Hydrian Heights. This Titan stands at 14 meters tall, and has long, luscious hair flowing from the head, down to the mid-back. She is extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat, as well as having the ability to harden a certain area of her body as an extra way of defense. By the sound of her roar, she can call any Mutant Enderman within 50 meters to her side to fight alongside her. Umbra, the current user of the Female Titan, is a calm and collected individual, however when in battle, she gives it her all.

**The Ironclad Titan**

This Titan is taken on by the bodyguard of the royal family. This Titan stands at 15 meters tall, and is covered in hardened iron. Like the Female Titan, the Ironclad Titan is able to harden any part of its body and stack it with its pre-existing armor. This Titan is capable of taking heavy damage, as its hardened armor can withstand anything. It can take bullets, grenades, even mass explosions. It also has the power to remove any armor from any part of its body to increase movement. (if necessary.) Brutus, the current user of the Ironclad Titan, is a protective being. He cares very much for his loved ones, which made him the perfect candidate for this Titan.

**The Blitz Titan**

This Titan is taken on by the bodyguard of the royal family. This Titan stands at 15 meters tall, and like the Female Titan, is able to harden as well as very skilled in hand-to-hand combat. It is able to run at very high speeds, as well as carrying extremely heavy objects, such as a boulder. (but why would it need to do that?) Eagan, the current user of the Blitz Titan, is a mild-mannered one. There have been instances where Eagan’s temper has been hanging by a thread, and this can sometimes jeopardize Eagan’s fighting techniques when in Titan Form.

**The Numen Titan**

This Titan is taken on by the child of the King and Queen. This Titan has the power to control any Mutant within a 50-meter radius, and stands at a great height of 15-meters. The head of the Numen Titan is usually bald, however, due to the current shifter, Radagast, having a blazing head of “hair,” his Titan has inherited this trait as well. Radagast is a very mellow fellow, and is usually oblivious to his surroundings, but is very defensive of what he loves.

**The Phantom Titan**

This Titan is taken on by the King of Hydrian Heights. Unlike the other 4 Titans, it stands at 5-meters tall, and walks on all fours instead of two. This Titan has the ability to create Mutant Endermen by the sound of its booming roar, and has a much larger radius than the Female Titan and the Numen Titan. Since it is quadruped, it is able to move much faster than the Blitz Titan. It also has the ability to speak, making it an Intelligent Titan. It also has very bulky arms, and two towering horns atop its hand, making it perfect if you were to ride it. (don’t.) Chamber, the user of the Phantom Titan, is very creative and loves to make things in his freetime, making him a perfect candidate for this Titan.

**WE WILL MOVE FORWARD, UNTIL WE DESTROY OUR ENEMIES.**
