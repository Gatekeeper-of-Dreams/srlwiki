# Lore Recap

### Rubendum

January 23, 2023 – Emi and Shad have noticed something red coming from a cave in RDS. It continuously grows and they feel it best not to make physical contact with it. It does seem intelligent and sentient as it made a heart shape and mimicked the shape of a nether portal.

January 24, 2023 – After Shad and Emi tried to make social contact to this creature or thing, it starts talking to Emi. He explains that his name is Rubendum and that he is stuck in a different world after being a refugee pushed from his home and he needs to recharge energy in order to go back home. He meant no harm but got offended by some of Dman’s nicknames for him.

January 29, 2023 – It’s revealed that Rubendum is a guard for an outpost where he lives and a war started back up. His outpost fell under enemy control and he was tortured before being sent away. He manages to get everyone’s help to return home and fight back.

February 3-4, 2023 – Rubendum allows everyone to come back to his world with him to attack the enemy. He does get mind controlled but after the enemy has been beaten, Rubendum thanks the group, gives them a gift, and everyone goes back home.

### Tale of Two Mages (Magelock/Coirbeachd)

February 26, 2023 – While working in their faction, Emi discovers a book left in their faction, presumably from the people that used to live there. It has a full list of spells and journaled the disaster that brought an end to the faction. It detailed how the faction was wiped out by a demon that was sealed in the wizard ring in the area. It’s decided that the orders close and the area is under strict supervision. Given the instructions of how to break it, wither flowers are banned from the area as well.

March 26, 2023 – All the faction leaders meet at the wizard ring to try to come up with a plan to keep the demon Coirbeachd from being released. As they discuss strategies, Coirbeachd awakens in his seal and attack the group, wanting to attack Emi in particular. After an attack, it’s decided that evacuation is needed.

April 8, 2023 – While looking over the refugee camp, Emi voices their concerns about a finding they had. There was a strong energy presence in the tower that used to belong to the elder. They discover that there is a wither flower being kept there, again stressing the importance of quarantining the nation.

April 9, 2023 – Coirbeachd starts talking with Dman. He makes a deal that if he frees him, RDS will be put into an era of prosperity. Dman agrees to helping Coirbeachd, ambushing Emi to steal the book with instructions to the ritual. Dman also goes to Nazcorp to steal the first rose from Naz and places it at the ring. Emi was able to survive due to the fairy gem they were holding. They get to the wizard ring as quickly as possible but was too late. It’s now known Dman is helping revive Coirbeachd. It is also revealed that the reason why Emi is targeted is because they are a descendant of the mage that originally sealed him away. An emergency meeting is called for the next day.

April 10, 2023 – A meeting is held to discuss the previous day’s events. Dman is to be locked up and under strict supervision and Kirameku is to be evacuated with limited people in and out. Dman is taken to a holding cell in Nazcorp where he will stay until the possession is dealt with.

April 17, 2023 – Emi builds an outpost by the Wizard Ring in order to be able to help with research and supervision in the area. They get attacked when they try to figure out how to get the book back and it’s found Emi’s weakness is soul sand. Afterwards, they’re ordered by Naz to evacuate to Yosokoa.

April 23, 2023 – Emi conducts a meeting to inform everyone of the action plan to be rid of Coirbeachd once and for all. They must unseal Coirbeachd and reseal him in a seal that lasts longer and requires less energy. After the meeting, everyone returns Dman to Nazcorp. They discuss a plan B where Dman is killed and the tie between him and Coirbeachd is severed. During the discussion, Coirbeachd takes control of Dman’s body and escapes containment. Moon, Shad, and Neek fight Coirbeachd off in order to keep Emi safe until he loses control. When he has control back, he gives Emi his sword and his armor so he doesn’t have much ability to hurt them anymore. He goes back into the cell to get some rest and Emi goes to tell Side and Naz.

April 24, 2023 – Emi informs Naz of Coirbeachd’s temporary escape. They discuss options to ensure there is no future escape. While Emi believes that they can reinforce the cell, Naz believes it would be better to send Dman to a cell in the End. A disagreement ensues and Emi doubles down.

April 28, 2023 – Emi finishes reinforcing Dman’s cell and while working, Coirbeachd takes control of Dman and escapes. Emi manages to get the rose before he does, but he tries to hold them hostage – the rose or their life. He is able to knock the rose out of Emi and Naz’s hands and put it in place at the seal. He does try to corner Emi but is unable to do any harm due to the fairy gems in her possession. Tired of the problems, Naz doubles down and locks Dman away in the end and enforces Emi stays in the shelter, RDS and Kirameku temporarily being in his control until the situation is properly dealt with. Given clues that there was a mage banished to the nether in the distant past, Emi gets Naz and Moon to investigate the area with them. They find ruins for a temporary shelter near a citadel, the only thing left behind being a diary belonging to someone named Evrn. They take the diary back to the shelter with them so they can figure out what has happened.

May 4, 2023 – After sensing a portal in the pond at the fairy ring, Emi has full belief that the last wither rose is on the other side of it. The only downsides are that the temple is being corrupted by Coirbeachd’s magic and the undead mage is guarding the rose from anyone who comes in, friend or foe. A UF meeting is called to inform everyone on what’s happened with Dman, Emi, and their nations. Emi warns Naz that Coirbeachd still grows stronger and that even his prison in the end may not hold Dman and Coirbeachd. She and Naz get into an argument. Emi ends up getting too worked up and runs away. Naz puts a bounty on her in order to try to get her back safely as soon as possible.

May 7, 2023 – Naz sends Shad and Neek to find Emi. Emi explains that she is scared to go back, but Shad and Neek are able to convince her to return. Naz is upset at Emi’s decision, but they both are able to calmly come to a point they can move on to focusing on the dungeon. Dman breaks out of the End prison and goes to the dungeon to get the rose. The United Factions follows in hot pursuit. Despite Emi and her teams’ efforts, Dman defeated the mage guarding the rose and steals the rose. Afterwards, Emi meets with Naz and speaks up about how she feels like she’s feeling like a prisoner in the shelter he made. After some discussion, Naz agrees to let her leave.

May 8, 2023 – Dman corners Emi at the fairy ring while she’s giving herself a pep talk. Dman tries to take Emi with him to the wizard circle and Emi refuses to go. Emi tries to fight him off but falls. Moon comes and tries to defend Emi but also loses. Dman chases Emi to Nazcorp where she’s cornered. Emi surrenders and follows Dman to the wizard ring. The final rose is placed and Emi’s magic is used to free Coirbeachd. Dman was able to take control back so Emi could make an attempt to seal Coirbeachd way but there wasn’t enough time and the spell fails. Coirbeachd takes Emi to his citadel in the nether and locks her away.

May 9, 2023 – Moon tells Naz that Emi’s been taken. They rush to the citadel and find her unresponsive and covered in burns. Naz takes her to the healing waters in Yosokoa’s ruins. Emi eventually wakes up. She’s taken to the hospital to rest and heal. Naz and Emi discuss plans on sealing Coirbeachd away once and for all.

May 10, 2023 – Shad comes in to visit Emi and check on her. Shad comforts her as she expresses her worry that her faction will no longer feel like a safe place for her. Later, Naz comes to get her and he escorts her to his office. He tells her about the ancient ritual his people used to use to sentence spirits to eternal suffering. Where it’s sure to take a while for her to heal, Naz ensures that she has a place to stay and rest until she’s able to return home.

May 13, 2023 – Emi and Naz set up to separate Dman from Coirbeachd and send Coirbeachd away. The spells used are a success. Dman is to be killed to ensure that his connection to Coirbeachd was severed, so Naz and Emi execute him on the top of Yosokoa’s temple. Coirbeachd is gone for good. Dman’s memories of Coirbeachd are gone and he’s sent to the hospital to be healed

May 14, 2023 – The solstice has arrived in Yosokoa. Everyone takes a moment to relax and Emi and Naz announce the big changes planned for Kirameku and Yosokoa.
