## History

### Beginning of Kinyakumo

Once upon a time, where the year of humanity is marked as "2357", humanity prayed for a savior in the midst of a seventh world war. They prayed for an angel to descend, free all from suffering. However, when the lightning struck the Azure Dragon fountain in Kiyomizu Temple located in Kyoto, Japan, instead of a savior, a large egg appeared.

The egg eventually hatched a young lady with deer like antlers, blue and red gradient eyes, described with a hint of lizardry, and patches of shiny scales that of obsidian spear heads, her scales intensified more and more towards the long, dragon like tail attached to her body at the back. The fur that runs along her spine glowed by the ends.

Many began to worship this young lady, claiming her as the savior that humanity prayed for, but for some, she could also be a demon from the depths of hell, finally coming to attack humanity while it is at its weakest states. Truth is, she is just a fallen warrior from heaven, a heaven not of any faith, a heaven that exists because the hopes and delusions of humanity, or by scientific terms at the time, the so called "Imaginary". A sort of "heaven" not well understood by many.

The Kiyomizu Temple, a refuge of war victims at the time, along with the temple's monks, took in this creature and named her Longlin, Long for her dragon like appearance, and Lin for the forest that the monks hopes to recover from the devastation of war. Even with the outcries of some groups of refugees, arguing that she is a demon who must be tossed away, the monks accepted her as their own, as part of their beliefs that "demons were not born, they were made".

With the help of the temple, and Longlin's incredible learning skills and speeds, she quickly became the smartest amongst all, with her ability to come up with strategies in the midst of chaos, her encouraging speech and her commanding voice quickly won the favors of many. She had started her own army, calling it "Kinyakumo".

Kinyakumo means "The Medicinal Eye of Gold", Longlin came up with the name in order to honor the nurses and doctors, those who overcame themselves, those who abandoned humanity, those who braved hails of war, those with a keen eye, understanding the emotions of others, all in order to save anyone they can. Longlin, like the monks of the temple, wants a more peaceful world.

And so, under her command, she quickly became recognized by more and more people, she has gained power and even faith. Many fought for her, trusting her to bring about a new future, the true symbol of hope, a general of an unfathomable army, blood spilled on many soils and once living flesh decayed away. By 2399, Longlin became the new "Emperor" of Japan. Many considered her as a masculine figure, hence the title of "Emperor".

### Forming of Modern Day Kinyakumo

No freedom is without restrictions, no peace is recognized without war. Longlin, finally gotten back to her heavenly senses, possible with her dragon blood.

Yielding her divine power, with a stomp, she split the earth, for it is her drums, beating at her intimidating march, the sound for a beautiful future. With a roar, she summoned thunder, flashes of energy overloading her enemies, for their death was instant and painless, no longer worrying. With a wave of her arm, she summoned gusts of strong winds that of hurricanes, knocking away those who inflicts pain, and soothing those who waited patiently for a cure to suffering. With the blood dripped from her wounds, she manifested them into tsunamis, washing away sins of the past. With a shine from her eyes, wildfire busted into the heart of darkness, exterminating shadows of humanity.

There is no ending, as long as she exists, the universe will keep thriving.

Lastly, with her divine spear, the Massiah, she has ended the Seventh World War. Piercing open a gate to imaginary, she has answered the lost. The deity who waits on the other side accepted everyone. She praised Longlin of her dedication, and so, the world woke up to a beautiful morning. For some, the seemingly everlasting world wars were a fever dream that ended humanity, but for others, it was real. Longlin now stands on the top of the world, for she has conquered humanity.

Under her rule, everything changed, humanity stood up, and advanced forward, walking on the bloody soil, they have achieved world peace. Kinyakumo expanded, from an army, to entirety of East Asian, now, she has the Earth, for the people, she now stands in a place respectable to a God. And under her breath, no more wars can be fought

Longlin focused on bringing knowledge to the people, advancing every technical aspects, even with the technological set backs of the world wars, Longlin brought them back, and made them even better. Eventually, humanity is able to conquer the moon, then other planets, even going as far as Neptune, but why stop there?

In the year 5555, humanity has officially conquered 7 exo-earth-like-planets along with each equipped with a Dyson Sphere\[^1]\(Energy harnessing straight from the star of the planet). Each ruled by one nation. For those in the past, a planet size nation could be called an empire, but with the existence of Longlin, it is only part of an empire.

With the 7 planets and their rulers, they've established The Divine Guardian Council. Each planet contributes their most gifted, most talented, the planet's ultimate, and have that individual be the Divine Guardian of that planet nation. It is a position even higher than that nation's rulers, for they represent the nation as a whole and has the honor to sit by the same table as Emperor Longlin.

The Council discuss together, planning the future for humanity.

But oh, why stop at just planets? Why not go into other realms?

### Modern Day Kinyakumo

With extensive planning, the Divine Guardians desires to make a super machine, or as they called it "Second God", an artificial, clockwork God made by humanity, to solve residue problems still reside within the world and quicken advancements. Emperor Longlin has longed for a time for her to retire from throne, and wants to live carefreely as a normal citizen, and hence forward with the plan.

In order to create the Clockwork God, they want to understand Imaginary, as such, the Q.I. research started, or quantum-imaginary, a field of science and physics devoted to understanding the fabrics of reality itself.

However, during the making of this machine, it caught the attention of the deity behind the curtain, the one who watches from the realm of Imaginary, due to the research of said field tampering with Q.I., The deity, who has seen all of time, tries her best to destroy and seal up the machine with her own power, in the process, damaging herself and the machine. For many, this marks the death of the deity.

Even with the damaged mechanism, it was still able to utilize its Q.I. tampering abilities. With last of its life, it stretched out a tear in the fabrics of reality, and hence, the portal of Q.I. Singularity formed, gaining access to another realm via imaginary.

Tsubaki, the youngest, and the seventh nation, focused mainly on businesses, trades, and technological research, was chosen as the explorer of outworlder realms. Under the rule of Tsubaki Koiwa, the Queen of the Queendom, along with her newly ascended Divine Guardian, Fuyuchi Koyuki, entered the Q.I. Singularity.

### Outworlder Branch - Kinyakumo-Tsubaki

After emerging from the other side of the Q.I. singularity, N.D.S.E. immediately got to work setting up a base and even mapping out an area for a palace to be constructed. After further scouting of the land, it seems like the realm they landed in already have societies and even empires.

Koyuki acted as the ambassador with the nearby nations and empires, in attempt to establish supports and connections. Although, Koyuki is still quite cautious, however, in this foreign realm, Koyuki is cut off from her connection with the Divine Guardians, therefore she has the freedom to say anything and do anything in the outworlder realm.

With the help of universal translation implants, important figures such as those higher ups at N.D.S.E. and Koyuki are able to understand the local tongue with ease. Koiwa doesn't seems to need them, for reasons unknown, she can automatically understand the local tongue without any translations.

### 1.5 Impact

Distrust began to build between the head of N.D.S.E (Vanessa) and Koyuki, over the judgement of Koiwa's actions in the past. Because of this distrust, Koiwa is afraid of an infighting, and especially afraid of Koyuki disliking her. Her overthinking and lack of communication with Koyuki eventually lead to a mental breakdown that caused the 1.5 Impact.

Almost like the First Impact, except Koiwa's flames and explosive forces were conceited inside the palace under the core suppression mechanisms; a system which is specifically designed to suppress extreme and sudden emotions that resonates with the phoenix core and Koiwa's spiritual core at the same time, supposedly, it should prevent the same disaster as the First Impact, however, the system is still in testing and it is imperfect.

Koiwa's cores meltdown anyways, and her intense emotions forced open the Gate of Guf. Like the Q.I. Singularity, the Gate of Guf leads to the imaginary, but a dimension of imaginary that is supposedly hidden and mirrors reality, it doesn't leads to another realm, it is just a physical manifestation of one's extremely strong thoughts.

Second in Command of N.D.S.E., Remilia Haganehara, also known as "Remmy", designed a specialized unit named ATLAS: Alternate Threshold Load Algorithm Suppressor, also named after the Greek mythology titan "Atlas", who held up the celestial sphere of the world. This incredibly large, human piloted, half biological humanoid machine, held the rings of the gate, stretching them open as they were collapsing down to a point, preventing further collision meltdown of the cores and also preventing the destruction of the outworlder realm they just settled in.

With the ring stretched, the Gate of Guf is unable to close and release its potential energy, thus suspended above the palace, where the phoenix core resides, also with this, the mirror realm of the palace is attracted to the real world palace due to the cores desire to become one. However, by unexplained miracle, the mirror palace seems to only be hovering above, with no movements at all.

This sparked many fears as well as inspiration for Q.I. research across Kinyakumo. With the incident also brings certain unpleasant events.

### Post 1.5 Impact

The land in which current day Kinyakumo-Tsubaki sits on in the outworlder realm, according to SSAIR (Local university) historical analysis teams, or H.A.T, the land was once a site for a civilization who vanished or was reduced rapidly due to unrecorded reasons, due to ambassador reports, a demonic entity seemed to have swept the area and caused massive reduction in population, leaving behind remnants of despair. Utilizing this report, H.A.T. concludes that the local land may have residual, unextinguished spirits that houses certain levels of force that could only be described as "magic".

The opening Gate of Guf seems to have an ongoing conflict with said local spirits, causing unexplained havoc such as sudden sickness, massive energy fluctuation and unstable energy entropy.

In response, Kinyakumo has cut ties with neighboring nation; Neo Kirameku, with the conclusion that the local spirits who belongs to the ancestor of Neo Kirameku's ruler are causing havoc due to conflicts with Q.I., in fear of any "magical" interactions that could intensify the havoc.

By isolating away from effects of this type of "magic", specifically sourced from Kirameku, Kinyakumo has closed its borders at Neo Kirameku, with any who moved into Kinyakumo from Neo Kirameku to be escorted by the K.P.D.- Kinyakumo Police Deparment. As well as local historical remnants extinguished by the Divine Spear of Tsubaki, controlled by the Queen Tsubaki Koiwa.

During this event, the K.P.D and N.D.S.E. received technological and medical aid from a neighboring empire called The Grand Yosokoan Empire, ruled under the reign of Nazorious.

#### Background

Longlin was once a Dragon General in Heaven, a strong half dragon half man who lead the Million Steel Army and fought the other factions in heaven for power and a search for utimate wisdom, however, he fell during battle, killed by his opponent, the Lion of Gui.

Even in his death, he fought through the afterlife for a chance to be reborn and settle his scores with the Lion of Gui, however, his rashness and his thirst for war was punished. Instead of reborn as his former, glorious self, he was reborn as a young lady inside the lotus leaves of a shrine.

Longlin retained some memories, although angry at the heavens, she eventually accepts the punishment, and live her life on Earth amongst mortals. Her leadership attitude won the favors of many and her still-clear divine knowledge helped aid humanity in technology. She quickly rose to power, eventually founding her own empire which she named Kinyakumo, meaning golden medicinal eye.

She decides that peace can also be an option, as she remembers her days in heaven were brutal, war and violence was the daily norm, and the batles she had to lead her army through in order to end the Seventh World War, peace could be a change of scenery.

Under her powerful rule, she decides to expand out to the stars, settling in other planets, whilist leaving the original Earth as diverse as it is, even if Kinyakumo became most of the Earth.

#### Personality

Longlin is the definition of "small but festy". Even after thousands of years living in her small mortal body, she still isn't used to being called "small" or "short", as she dislikes being teased for her height, because of it, Longlin often appear to her subjects as a 80 meter tall hologram dragon man, only those who are close to her such as the various kingdom/queendom leaders or The Divine Guardian Council knows of her true appearances.

She can become extremely straightforward with her words, as she believes that sugarcoating is a waste of time, and that those who cannot handle what is reality are not fit for rule or handle heavy duties. She favors stratigy over brute force, and would often personally adjust taxes, flow of mints or credit values on a massive scale between her nations in order for the economy to function without massive dips of depression or market crashings. Longlin views her duties as a chess game, and her goal is to keep it balanced on all sides.

Longlin views war as a waste of finite resources, despite her former title as a War General, she despises war as it is a factor of inbalance for the war time economy it brings. Conflicts without a proper reason is just a waste. Even with every resources at her disposal, she still favors conserving resources.

She has the keen senses to read people's emotions and accurately predict how people and their properties disperse, however, she often fails expressing emotions on her own.

#### Abilities

* Longlin's "Divine Spear", also known as Spear of Massiah, is only used for when a nation in the empire is under serious threat, a type of threat that the nation's leaders are unable to solve on their own. It has the power to vaporize regular matter into antimatter in a controlled scale, as well as create a barrier and or rift in space by warping the space around it due to extreme force. The spear alone can open the Gate of Guf[^1]; An imaginary space opposite to that of reality. So called, "Spear of Massiah" is due to it only being used in order to save a nation from disaster.
* Process data in extreme speeds. As the Emperor of Kinyakumo, along with her divine body, she has trained herself to read millions of data in matter of seconds. She has extreme reflex and can deflect any incoming attacks up to 99% speed of light. She can read attacks almost 1 second from the future.
* Due to her being a "pure dragon", she has the ability to change weather with her divine power, also due to this, she can manipulate certain elements to certain extend (Earth, Fire, Air, Water, aspects of growth and decay (does not including life and death)). There is no real scientific explaination for how she does it, it is suspected there are manipulation of imaginary at play.

|        Age: _25_        |
| Height: _5'7" (170 cm)_ |
|     Gender: _Female_    |
|    Specie: _Human(?)_   |

#### Background

Fuyuchi Koyuki has no parents, she was found on a mountain when she was around 10. The local orphanage took her in, it is said that she could be a reincarnation of the Lion of Gui, the same Lion who felled Longlin from heaven, but there are no clear evidence on such a claim, the claim mostly stemed from her naturally golden blonde hair, the same luxurious fluff and shine as the fur of the Lion from the legends. She had no recollection of any memories prior to her discovery.

Koyuki has a natural talent in martial arts, and practice the arts of the swords at a young age, by the time she was 13, she defeated Kinyakumo's swordsmaster Guilin, because of her incredible skill, the headmaster of the orphanage often took her on tournaments, even if they were brutal. Koyuki never really got a chance to interact with other kids, except for the headmaster's kid; Vanessa. Koyuki mostly focused on honing her swordsmanship, however, as time goes on, Koyuki eventually felt that her talent was being extorted and exploited. She hosted a final duel between the headmaster and herself, which Koyuki won not soon after the duel even started. The headmaster, not admitting defeat, decided to pit Vanessa against Koyuki.

Vanessa has no prior skills in swords, she mostly practiced with spears and polearms, Koyuki, stunted by her own emotions, hesitated on attacking her only friend. Eventually as they grew tired, their senses dulled and they end up cutting each other from the shoulder to waist.

Even after injuries, the headmaster still pit them to fight against each other, still going on tours, but this time, it is just Vanessa and Koyuki fighting, it eventually got to the point that they almost killed each other in a duel, in one of the duels, Koyuki injured the nerves on her right arm, she had it amputated and replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic that looks the exact same as her old arm, in order to hide the fact that she got injuried.

They both shared the same room as they were hospitalized, Vanessa's forgetful, positive and happy-go-lucky attitude suggested that she and Koyuki should run away and live on their own, instead of always having to fight each other. At the time, they were both 17, they ran away from the orphanage, but the headmaster always chased them down. One day, Vanessa and her father (headmaster) got into a fight over personal freedom, in the heat of the argument, her father sliced her with a sword, reopening the old shoulder to waist wound she first got from Koyuki. Koyuki, rushing in to defend Vanessa, ended up decapitating the headmaster, killing him.

Afterwards, they decided to take whatever the headmaster had and run away, starting their own lives. Koyuki and Vanessa ended up going to their own separate paths, with Koyuki joining the police force whilist Vanessa entered college and became an intern at N.D.S.E.

Koyuki's heavy sense of duty quickly rose her rank to a police captain, she was also responsible for protecting the royal family members at the time (pre-first impact), that includes Tsubaki Koiwa, from the countless assassination attempts. Even with bribery and higher level orders from the head of the police department, Koyuki still stuck to her responsibility of protecting Koiwa, as demanded by the King at the time.

She is one of many who survived the first impact by shear luck, as she was summoned to the Lunarian Capital (space station) just days before the impact, however, also due to her being summoned there, the First Impact occured as she wasn't able to save Koiwa from being burnt. She regrets accepting the summon and decides to dedicate herself as Koiwa's bodyguard and part-time police officer post-impact. This caused Koiwa to fall in love with her and personally promoted her to the Divine Guardian Council. Because of her excellent mastery of swords and her extensive knowledge from her police duties, she was able to pass the entry exam with ease. Although there are skepticisms from the other members of the Divine Guardians due to the council members all joined at younger ages and are now hundreds of years old, Koyuki is the only young member of the council, even so, they accepted her, as the last Divine Guardian of Tsubaki perished hundreds of years ago, and they have not yet found a replacement till now.

#### Personality

Koyuki has a heavy sense of duty, she is still very much married to her policing job, and would still assist in law enforcement whenever she can. Her strong sense of justice and her skills had the citizens giving her the "Lion of Gui" nickname, referencing the Lion General from Heaven who was the primary figure for "good, selfless warrior". She has trouble expressing herself and often can't find the right words to describe emotions, however she is very understanding of criminal psychology. She is very stern and doesn't often understand jokes or hints of romance, she always speak in a formal, poetic manner, she is also polite and good mannered. Koyuki is incredibly brave, so much so that she often puts her life on the line, but would still miraculously get the job done. She tries to solve conflicts by talking or compromises, fighting is only last resort.

#### Abilities

* Extreme speed and agility, mainly due to her years of sword practicing and martial arts.
* Can utilize any object as a weapon, if she can move it, it's a weapon
* Photographic memories (specifically for maps and faces)
* EMP disruption, it comes from the cybernetic mod inside the prosthetic arm.
* Ambidextrous, she has the ability to use either hand to perform skillful tasks.

#### Background

Tsubaki Koiwa was one of the "pure" human bloodline, a bloodline stem from the original Earth, where they have no genetic mods. At most, they have implants that help with their skeletal, besides that, the Tsubaki royal bloodline is very against implants or genetic modding.

Koiwa was borned with pink hair, fading to blue on the tips, her eyes were also a gradient of pink to blue. These features shocked the royal family, believing that her mother had utilized a gene mod in secret, however, with multiple testings, it is suggested that Koiwa's mother never used any type of modifications, and that Koiwa was naturally just born with those features. Because of this, Koiwa immedietly became the favorite of the King, believing that she is blessed by the divine. Her relatives became jealous of her, spreading vicious rumours and lies, in attempt to ruin Koiwa's reputation.

Even with evident lack of genetic modding, said claim still circulates around the royal family, with the other members of the family even go as far as tamper DNA or purposely set up evidence to show that her mother had attempted genetic modification, to that point that they outright accused her mother of violating family code.

When Koiwa was only 15, she was forced to witness as the royal family members set fire, burning Koiwa's mother alive.

After her mother's brutal death, Koiwa decides that she wants to abandon royal family duties and become a normal citizen, pursuing the study of medicine, however, she is always dragged back by the King, in attempts to prepare her for rule.

On the day of throne competition, in order to remove Koiwa out of the picture, the other members of the royal family tied her up, and set fire, burning Koiwa as they did to her mother years prior. The cries of Koiwa caught the attention of the Divine Phoenix, who saw her strong desire for revenge of the injust and to survive.

The Divine lent her a hand, and Koiwa was resurrected from the cinders of her burnt corpse, into a new immortal body, whilist caused the devestating event that is the First Impact.

| Area of Impact: Heavy Impact at the Eastern hemisphere(10 \~ 20 KM radius) of Neodynus, a crater around 11 KM(36K ft) deep[^3]. The effects of the impact spread across the globe |
| Casualties: \~700 Million                                                                                                                                                         |

The most devestating event that Neodynus, or the nation of Tsubaki has ever experienced. It was a sudden, explosive rage of fire that swept through everything on the planet. At the core of the explosion, it was estimated that temperature had reached 30 million degrees C (54 million F), twice that of the core of the sun. It was calculated that heat of that magnitude would of completely vaporized the planet, however, by some miracle unexplained, it was only heavily effected around a certain range. It was suspected that a Gate of Guf was opened right below the source of the explosion, to dampen the effects. This hasn't been confirmed by the Emperor Longlin yet, as she would be the only person to be able to freely open the Gate of Guf

At the moment of explosion, the sight was what could only be described as "a God emerging from Earth", with its firey wings spread out, standing on the planet, accompanied by rains of fire and uncanny screeches that can only be described as "souls coming from hell seeking for revenge". Noted from the spacestation of Neodynus; Lunarian Capital, the space station that was also an artifical moon for Neodynus.

\[Will also provide imagery/audio for this too]

The effect of the impact lasted around 2 to 3 years, with the planet graduately cooling overtime. The First Command of N.D.S.E, Vanessa Haganehara, came up with the planet cooling towers that could withstand the temperature of the sun. With careful mission control, the towers were dropped on the planet in order to accelerate cooling. When the planet cooled down to a safer temperature. Vanessa herself extracted Koiwa from the Phoenix core, that at the time, was only as hot as magma.

**Post-First Impact**

Nation of Tsubaki was able to quickly recover thanks to efforts of N.D.S.E, however, every last of the royal family perished, leaving only Koiwa. Automatically, Koiwa became the new Queen of Tsubaki. To surpress suspicions and outrage due to First Impact, N.D.S.E had to control the media and place white lies in order to steer the possible rebellion that could stem from Koiwa becoming Queen. Afterall, she caused the First Impact, even if it wasn't intentional.

**Realm-Expansion Project**

Tsubaki was choosen as the lead for the Realm-Expansion Project, or R.E.P, initiated by the Emperor Longlin and The Divine Guardian Council. At this point, Koiwa has gotten used to being a leading figure, even though she was mostly guided with the help of the Divine Guardian assigned to her nation, as well as N.D.S.E.

The purpose of this project is to further study the effects of quantum-imaginary portals, and to expand on the "Many-Worlds" theorem. As well as to aid The Divine Guardians for their research needs for the super machine.

Koiwa has no choice but to oblige.

New realm already has other nations, however, Koiwa decides to stay neutral, sticking to the "no attacking unless threatened" rule.

#### Personality

Koiwa herself has a playful, fruity and sly personality, likes to flirt with women (specifically her Divine Guardian), sometimes shy and dislikes talking to outsiders. She doesn't often take things seriously and "memes" around, she prefers that way in order to hide the emotional trauma she has from the First Impact. When she is serious, it feels off putting and unpredictable. She dispises fire, or any flame related thing, such as flickering lights, kitchen stoves, lighters, even paper fires used for stage prop. She also dislikes spicy food and has a cat's tongue when it comes to hot foods.

However, her phoenix counterpart is straightforward, often deemed as rude but honest, offensivly logical and hard to debate with for her quick wits for pointing out flaws in debates.

#### Abilities

* "Divine Spear" Spear of Veritas, it has the ability to morph to adjust with its surroundings. Like the Divine Spear that Longlin wields, it has the ability to open Gate of Guf, however Koiwa has not grant the ability to control that yet. Koiwa calls the spear as the "brutally honest toothpick", as it is named after a Roman Goddess of Truth. It is the ultimate weapon of Tsubaki that only Koiwa; now a Divine being, can wield and control.
* Diverse knowledge in medicine and medical, can make almost any type of medicine (given materials).

### Holidays

#### Lunarian New Year /Nongli Xinnian (农历新年)

Celebrated on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd full moon after the new year approaches (On Neodynus, Tsubaki's original planet, new year is counted when the artificial moon aligns with the planet and its star in a straight line after one orbit around its star), sometimes people celebrate them right when the local calendar hits January 1st of next year, but officially, the holiday season doesn't start till the 1st full moon approaches.

Culturally similar to Chinese New Year in terms of food preparation, decors, temples and shrine rituals, traditions in family gathering, however it has its own charm with the Tri-Beast dance.

#### Tri-Beast Parade / Sankemono no odori (三獣の踊)

The three divine descends of heaven: The Dragon, The Lion and The Phoenix (Fenghuang) from ancient fables. The dance is to celebrate their "retirement" from the ever lasting chaos in heaven, into a new life full of new experiences. All 3 of the dances are performed by the same group of performers. As the dances occur, there will always be bands or orchestras playing nearby or behind the performers. The performance are part of the Lunarian New Year.

On the **1st full moon**, the dragon roams around the cities, performers dressed in azure silk clothing holds up bamboo rods that props up the long, paper lantern body of the azure dragon, Dragon of Lin. Usually the size and length of a public bus or a metro train. The head performer utilizes string manipulation to make the dragon's head blink and its jaws move, or even activate the propane ignition for the dragon to spit blue fire, the gas pipe leading to the ignition is designed a way so it emits a roaring sound effect when the pressurized propane gas releases. The musical for this one utilizes instruments such as drums, flutes, and a special type of "water speaker" that emulates sounds of ocean waves. The 1st dance is always the dragon, as the dragon is the first descender. A celebration for the dragon's divine, element controlling power forming Kinyakumo, also very much a birthday gift to the Emperor Longlin.

On the **2nd full moon**, the lion waltz around the cities. The head of the lions, the golden lion, with its fur all shiny and gold-like, resembling the Lion of Gui, who is the second descender. Following the Golden Lion, are many lines of "lion cubs", often made up of locals who dress up in lion themed cosplays (masks, fictional characters, fur-suits). The Lion dance is very similar to the Chinese Lion Dance. The performers of the lion dance often utilize the lion to interact with the locals, often giving away random holiday objects as gifts, such as paper lanterns, origami, fruits or lion minted gold coins. Because the performers for the lion dance are all covered under the golden fur of the lion, the performers often carry backpacks for gifts to give away. A celebration for the selflessness and kindness of the Lion of Gui.

On the **3rd full moon**, the phoenix flies around the cities. The phoenix lantern is mostly remote controlled by the body motion capture of the head performer, utilizing military technology for mecha pilots. The head performer wears a silk robe of pink and blue gradient and a paper bird mask, as they dance a ballet that tells the story of the pheonix, utilizing smooth and elegant movements to capture the phoenix's spirits of feminine, power and hope. The other performers act as side characters. Besides the head performer, there are even amounts of side performers divided left and right, one side with pink silk robes and the other with blue silk robes. They often dance in harmony and switch positions. As the phoenix lantern flies with the performer, the locals release their own lanterns with their own wishes. A celebration for the phoenix's self-discovery whilst fighting the two opposite sides of itself, a tribute to the Phoenix of Tsubaki. Compare to the other dances, this one is more melodic and soothing.

#### Shukakuki Harvest Festival (収穫季)

A festival that occurs near the end of summer till the end of fall, this festival often lasts 2 or 3 months, depending on the weather. To celebrate the harvest of crops. Locals would often set out shop fronts by nearby shrines in hopes of their crops being blessed by the local deity and would sell well. To celebrate the deity of nature and the gift of farming, local shrines would perform kagura dances in the themes of Earth forming, and or nature in general. The perfect festival to buy or stock up fruits and vegetables whilist joining the festival spirit.

#### Shinkon Matsuri (神魂祭り)

Shinkon translates to "souls/spirits of gods/deities". Similar to real world Halloween and Obon festival, the Shinkon Matsuri is a festival for the dead and other paranormal beings, to celebrate their mutual, friendly relationships with the locals, as well as a time for deceased ancestors to return.

It occurs right after Shukakuki Harvest Festival, based off of a legend that spirits are jealous and yearn of the bountiful fruits and vegetables that humans can have and taste, and so the spirits often manifest themselves in disguised human forms to purchase human food with fake money that turns into leaves after the spirit leaves, some spirits even straight up steal.

In order to counter these spirits' undesirable behaviors, the local shrines and temples put up offerings for the spirits to take away instead. Family households also set up small shrines with statues of the green hair green horned shinigami (god of death) and incense as well as horses, ox, donkey, chicken statues made out of various fruits and vegetables, in order for them to act as guides for the deceased ancestor to find their way into the household and celebrate the bountiful harvest together, or to ensure the family's safety from other evil spirits.

Due to the spirits being active during Shinkon Matsuri, many paranormal incidents are recorded, and it is up to the local shrine maidens and or exorcists to send them away, but really, most of the time these "incidents" were more on the locals being overly paranoid and sees everything as an action of a spirit.

Scientifically, it is stated that during Shinkon Matsuri, the activities of Quantum-Imaginary fluctuations would increase tremendously, it is also theorized that due to the holiday being a traditional thing that happens at the end of Shukakuki, people's fears could manifest via Q.I., and hence increasing the fluctations. In other words, people are so used to being afraid during Shinkon Matsuri that the spirits might as well manifest itself from said fears.

#### Heavenly Descendants' Nights of Peace / Anye (霄裔安夜)

A bit similar to real world Christmas, it is also celebrated around the same time as real world Christmas.

Based off of the Three Childrens and The Divine Weapon legend, where the three childrens of "heaven" (Imaginary) descended onto the mortal realm after fighting the chaos of heaven, coming to the mortal realm to live amongst the mortals, being their guides to rightousness. To celebrate their descend, no one works on the day of Anye, it is a day of relaxation.

At the Night of Peace, all electricity shuts off in order for the people to view the stars above without light pollution (Except for military, defense systems and emergency shelters, they run on back up when electricity shuts off.), and the electricity cuts back on when sun rises again. The locals prepare food before shut off time and gather together with family and or friends to watch the stars. It is also a time where people gather together to share their stories of the year before the year ends.

The day after Anye, households, shrines, temples and government buildings all go through massive clean ups, to clean and throw away the "chaos" that accumulated over the year, preparing for the new year to come.

### Fables and Legends

#### Three Childrens and The Divine Weapons

When the concept of a concept was formed, so were many things. First, the sky was created, the universe itself, then, a tree was planted, the World Tree, its branches reached infinity, far and wide, then, there was life, and from life, the Imaginary was formed. The first heaven that housed many spirits, many souls and emotions, it was pure freedom, but chaotic, there was no sorts of boundary, no ideas of violence yet also no ideas of kindness. And so, a deity was borned to manage the Imaginary. And thus life is stable, free of insanity.

The deity, feeling lonely, constructed three beings, the Dragon, the Lion, and the Phoenix (Fenghuang). The Deity then asked them to watch over the World Tree, enduring its existence. But as they watched over the world, they were contaminated by emotions.

The dragon became conscious of himself, seeing the intelligence of humanity, he often thought to himself of his own intelligence, studying the power of humanity and their advancements, he came to the belief that he too, can utilize his own sentience for knowledge, and so, The Dragon seeks the ultimate wisdom.

The Lion became emotional of human kindness, she envied the close relationships of humans, and so, The Lion became despirate for a friend.

The Phoenix, fueled with injustice that humans can commit, is angered, she believes that the human emotions are a hinderance to balance, and so, The Phoenix desired destruction.

The Lion's idea conflicted with The Phoenix, and so they fought, one cling onto hope of creation, and the other, the despair of destruction. The Dragon, sees them as foolish for fighting, joined in on the war in order to end the war.

With their in fighting, the World Tree was not cared for, and thus, it collapsed, withered. With the crumbling of life, the imaginary would soon follow.

Under his breath, he commanded countless warriors under him, attacking both the Lion and the Phoenix, it was a brutal war. The Lion, focused on defense, wanting to be the pennicle of mercy, she refused to kill, however, the war was a torment itself. The dragon, effected by the phoenix's violence, became bloodthirsty. To bring upon mercy, the Lion pierced the dragon, felling him.

The Phoenix, at the critical moment, pierced the Lion, felling her after realizing what she has done, she regrets her violent outburst, with her weakened emotional state, she was overwhelmed by the revenge hungry warriors of the dragon. And she too, fell along with them. The three childrens destroyed each other due to their own uncontrollable emotions, falling from heaven into mortal realm.

The deity, disappointed, but loves her creations, erased strands of history in order to bring the World Tree back to life, however, as punishment, they were to live alongside mortals.

"Live to learn how to control your emotions," said the deity, "once you are able controlled your's, you may return to me."

The three childrens, filled with regrets, decided to accept their punishments. They walked the mortal realm, observing every aspects of life, they gathered their thoughts, and became the voices of humanity. The deity was impressed, she called for them, but they became attached to living amongst mortals, and so, the deity let them, but as a reward, they were each gifted with a divine weapon of their own, cathered to their personalities, and they were to be the weapons that protects all life.

#### Dragon of Lin

A dragon of obsidiant scales, shining through the darkest nights. He will one day reborn as a savior, commanding humanity out of their darkest moments, and to rule all of mortals.

#### Lion of Gui

A lion of unfathomable kindness, her golden fur shall be the beacon of hope that guides humanity to salvation, however, from her blade, the pennacle of her mercy, she shall tell the tale of darkness born from the blinding light of empathy

#### Phoenix (Fenghuang) of Tsubaki

A phoenix of blue and red, her incredible determination and her insatiable rage over injustice shall be the beacon of despair that tells the tale of emotions, at the point of her spear, she shall become the light born from the overwhelming darkness of apathy

#### Lunarian Tales

Once upon a time, a large rabbit was born, the rabbit was born out of nothing, she had no spirit nor soul, the rabbit of Emptiness. In this vast space, she floated and kicked her legs, searching for something, anything in this lonely space. Eventually, she found another rabbit, who is energetic and full of spirits, the rabbit of Wholeness.

Wholeness was hammering a mortar full of stars, but the stars are so bright that Wholeness could not see where she is aiming. Seeing this, Emptiness offered to help, by balling herself up, her dark fur absorbed the star's brightness, eating the light so that Wholeness could finally see. Moved by her action, Wholeness hugged Emptiness, and Wholeness's pure white fur absorbed the darkness of Emptiness, understanding her lonliness, whilist Emptiness's heart was filled by the love of Wholeness, understanding her kindness.

They accepted each other, and so, they lived together, forming a celestial sphere, which they called "Moon". Whilist Wholeness made mochi out of stars, Emptiness would forever absorb them, Wholness felt that her mochi is being appreciated, while Emptiness no longer feels lonely.

#### The Demon of Heaven and The Angel of Hell

A demon born of hell became curious of mortals, and wanted to study why certain spirits come to hell, and thus, the demon went to live with the mortals. And there, he saw the terrible things that the mortals did to each other, he gasped, and felt sorry for the ignorant, yet feeling that they deserved the punishment in hell, however, feeling sorry of those who did not know of their sins, the demon sought to teach the mortals of the definition of sin.

Whilist in Heaven, an angel became curious of mortal limits, and wanted to see the line between sinful and pure, and so, he also went to live with the mortals. And there, he saw the kindness and empathy that mortals could have, he gasped, how could mortals be such gentle beings? and so, the angel became an ambassador of lies, with his power, he spread the lies of sinfulness.

From their actions, the heaven promoted the demon, whilist hell pulled down the angel.

In the end, they both fulfilled their desires, however, by pursuing their desires with a narrowed focus, they were no longer themselves.

#### The Comforter of Death

Death is the balancer of life, they exist in harmony, however, sometimes, life feels unfair, and that death is the mercy, and sometimes, death feels unfair, and that life is the mercy.

Many are afraid of dying, afraid of losing things they love, afraid of not obtaining things they want to obtain, however, in the eyes of the deity, nothing is lost.

At the end of the tunnel, she awaits there, and with a smile, she welcomes you in a dream, a world of your memories, merged and constructed, your thoughts, your desires, she breaks them down for you. Like watching a show, you remember the memories you've gathered, the times you've spent being alive, it is you, that have constructed memories, memories of everything, and everything involved would have memories of you. Animals, people, as you remember them, they will also remember you. You are never alone, for she will always be with you, guiding you through your own memories, even in the darkness ones, she is there to comfort you.

Existing is to feel. As she holds your hands through the dark times, she reminds you that in the midst of the mud, a flower will always bloom, that flower is a life in itself, forced to bloom by insatiable will to experience the sun, the kind, fluffy bee that occationally visits, the violent storm and the freezing hail, but in the end, the flower leaves a mark of its existence, even if it is no longer alive. For the future visitors, they learn of your history, your markings on the world, from your remains, they discover everything around you, the stories that were born from your actions, the tales that would past on and on.

Don't believe that you will become forgotten, as long as you once existed, you will never be forgotten, as your existence was also seen by her, from behind the curtains of Imaginary. Even if no mortals will remember you, even if your mortal husk was entirely wiped out, your spirit will always be in the hands of her. Why worry about other mortals remembering you? When there is a deity who would.

Her name is Mohrpas, she is the Seventh lord, she will always rememeber you when no one else would. So, fear not, for as long as she exists, death will just be the beginning of the end.

#### Zen-Buddhism

Zen-buddhism, as its name suggests, is about the same as real life Zen-Buddhism. It focuses on ways of meditating to achieve inner peace and enlightenment. A religion of patience and mindfulness, believing that with proper patience, one can ascend to greater realms free of mortal pain, it is more of a saying that with patience, one can overcome anything, and become "immortal" in thoughtfulness, immune to any short-temperment and anger, and learn to think with a steady mind even in the most panic-inducing situations.

#### Sephirahism

Reference off of real life Christianity, added with a mix of kabbalah teachings, it has its own narration of the massiah, however the massiah(s) being the 11 Sephirahs from Otzar (Heaven/Imaginary Realm) who merged into one ultimate being, who then sacrificed itself in order for the humanity to learn the definition of sin, so that humanity would void of it and enter Otzar to be free of any burden. It stemmed from the studies of the old Three Childrens and The Divine Weapon fable, as well as certain scientific discoveries of the Quantum-Imaginary, believing that the true Heaven is actually the Imaginary Realm where all things gather together. The Bible of Sephirah is a rewritten, retranslated versions of different books describing miracles and teachings of God. It has similar teachings to other religions about proper mannerism, however described in a way to rid all burdens onto god.

[^1]: Gate of Guf is a portal to Guf, also known as Otzar, the treasury of souls described in hebrew teachings. However, in this case, Guf is also referring to the "Imaginary" realm. Imaginary is a realm where everything merges together, emotions, spirits and souls, it is a realm where everything and anything is possible. It is Tchai's explaination to the OC maker's imagination. A realm of creativity that is the human mind.
