## History

### Basics

Kinyakumo is founded when the current Emperor Longlin helped humanity advance in extreme speeds by utilizing her divine knowledge. Wanting to take a break from her former warmongering life, she decides that it is best for Kinyakumo to exist on trade alone, instead of war.

Due to the empire being trade oriented and the Emperor's keen senses on making compromises, Kinyakumo expanded out of its original planet earth, into other earth-like planets. After 2 thousand years have passed, Kinyakumo has conquered 7 Earth-like planets and a dyson sphere for each.

After another thousand years have passed, The Guardian council decided that they need an even more powerful technology, a super machine that can finally solve all problems that humanity has, diseases, poverty, hunger and sub-conflicts. In order to advance their research into achieving their goal, they decided to expand to other worlds by utilizing the quantum technology that Kinyakumo possesses. The local deity, sensing a disturbence due to the creation of their machine, decides to utilize her power and seals it away. For some, it declares the end of the deity.

Even with the surpression, the machine still manages to open portals to other realms. One of seven nations, Tsubaki, was choosen by the Emperor as well as The Guardians to represent Kinyakumo while they expand into the foreign realm, reason being Tsubaki's already rich industry and technology research centers such as the SSAIR (Shinoyama Science Analysis Instition of Research).

#### Background

Longlin was once a Dragon General in Heaven, a strong half dragon half man who lead the Million Steel Army and fought the other factions in heaven for power and a search for utimate wisdom, however, he fell during battle, killed by his opponent, the Lion of Gui.

Even in his death, he fought through the afterlife for a chance to be reborn and settle his scores with the Lion of Gui, however, his rashness and his thirst for war was punished. Instead of reborn as his former, glorious self, he was reborn as a young lady inside the lotus leaves of a shrine.

Longlin retained some memories, although angry at the heavens, she eventually accepts the punishment, and live her life on Earth amongst mortals. Her leadership attitude won the favors of many and her still-clear divine knowledge helped aid humanity in technology. She quickly rose to power, eventually founding her own country which she named Kinyakumo, meaning golden medicinal eye.

She decides that peace can also be an option, as she remembers her days in heaven were brutal, war and violence was the daily norm, and that peace is a change of scenery.

Under her powerful rule, she decides to expand out to the stars, settling in other planets, whilist leaving the original Earth as diverse as it is, even if Kinyakumo became most of the Earth.


#### Personality

Longlin is the definition of "small but festy". Even after thousands of years living in her small mortal body, she still isn't used to being called "small" or "short", as she dislikes being teased for her height, because of it, Longlin often appear to her subjects as a 80 meter tall hologram dragon man, only those who are close to her such as the various kingdom/queendom leaders or The Divine Guardian Council knows of her true appearances.

She can become extremely straightforward with her words, as she believes that sugarcoating is a waste of time, and that those who cannot handle what is reality are not fit for rule or handle heavy duties. She favors stratigy over brute force, and would often personally adjust taxes, flow of mints or credit values on a massive scale between her nations in order for the economy to function without massive dips of depression or market crashings. Longlin views her duties as a chess game, and her goal is to keep it balanced on all sides.

Longlin views war as a waste of finite resources, despite her former title as a War General, she despises war as it is a factor of inbalance for the war time economy it brings. Conflicts without a proper reason is just a waste. Even with every resources at her disposal, she still favors conserving resources.

She has the keen senses to read people's emotions and accurately predict how people and their properties disperse, however, she often fails expressing emotions on her own.


#### Abilities

- Longlin's "Divine Spear", also known as Spear of Massiah, is only used for when a nation in the empire is under serious threat, a type of threat that the nation's leaders are unable to solve on their own. It has the power to vaporize regular matter into antimatter in a controlled scale, as well as create a barrier and or rift in space by warping the space around it due to extreme force. The spear alone can open the Gate of Guf[^3]; An imaginary space opposite to that of reality. So called, "Spear of Massiah" is due to it only being used in order to save a nation from disaster.
- Process data in extreme speeds. As the Emperor of Kinyakumo, along with her divine body, she has trained herself to read millions of data in matter of seconds. She has extreme reflex and can deflect any incoming attacks up to 99% speed of light. She can read attacks almost 1 second from the future.

[^3]: Gate of Guf is a portal to Guf, also known as Otzar, the treasury of souls described in hebrew teachings. However, in this case, Guf is also referring to the "Imaginary" realm. Imaginary is a realm where everything merges together, emotions, spirits and souls, it is a realm where everything and anything is possible. It is Tchai's explaination to the OC maker's imagination. A realm of creativity that is the human mind.

[^1]: Age of when Koiwa became Immortal

#### Background
Tsubaki Koiwa was one of the "pure" human bloodline, a bloodline stem from the original Earth, where they have no genetic mods. At most, they have implants that help with their skeletal, besides that, the Tsubaki royal bloodline is very against implants or genetic modding.

Koiwa was borned with pink hair, fading to blue on the tips, her eyes were also a gradient of pink to blue. These features shocked the royal family, believing that her mother had utilized a gene mod in secret, however, with multiple testings, it is suggested that Koiwa's mother never used any type of modifications, and that Koiwa was naturally just born with those features. Because of this, Koiwa immedietly became the favorite of the King, believing that she is blessed by the divine. Her relatives became jealous of her, spreading vicious rumours and lies, in attempt to ruin Koiwa's reputation. 

Even with evident lack of genetic modding, said claim still circulates around the royal family, with the other members of the family even go as far as tamper DNA or purposely set up evidence to show that her mother had attempted genetic modification, to that point that they outright accused her mother of violating family code.

When Koiwa was only 15, she was forced to witness as the royal family members set fire, burning Koiwa's mother alive.

After her mother's brutal death, Koiwa decides that she wants to abandon royal family duties and become a normal citizen, pursuing the study of medicine, however, she is always dragged back by the King, in attempts to prepare her for rule.

On the day of throne competition, in order to remove Koiwa out of the picture, the other members of the royal family tied her up, and set fire, burning Koiwa as they did to her mother years prior. The cries of Koiwa caught the attention of the Divine Phoenix, who saw her strong desire for revenge of the injust and to survive.

The Divine lent her a hand, and Koiwa was resurrected from the cinders of her burnt corpse, into a new immortal body, whilist caused the devestating event that is the First Impact.

### First Impact
|Incident Stats|
|---|
|Area of Impact: Heavy Impact at the Eastern hemisphere(10 ~ 20 KM radius), a crater around 11 KM(36K ft) deep[^2]. The effects of the impact spread across the globe|
|Casualties: ~700 Million|
[^2]: Depth of the Mariana Trench

The most devestating event that Neodynus, or the nation of Tsubaki has ever experienced. It was a sudden, explosive rage of fire that swept through everything on the planet. At the core of the explosion, it was estimated that temperature had reached 30 million degrees C (54 million F), twice that of the core of the sun. It was calculated that heat of that magnitude would of completely vaporized the planet, however, by some miracle unexplained, it was only heavily effected around a certain range. It was suspected that a Gate of Guf was opened right below the source of the explosion, to dampen the effects. This hasn't been confirmed by the Emperor Longlin yet, as she would be the only person to be able to freely open the Gate of Guf

At the moment of explosion, the sight was what could only be described as "a God emerging from Earth", with its firey wings spread out, standing on the planet, accompanied by rains of fire and uncanny screeches that can only be described as "souls coming from hell seeking for revenge". Noted from the spacestation of Neodynus; Lunarian Capital, the space station that was also an artifical moon for Neodynus.

[Will also provide imagery/audio for this too]

The effect of the impact lasted around 2 to 3 years, with the planet graduately cooling overtime. The First Command of N.D.S.E, Vanessa Haganehara, came up with the planet cooling towers that could withstand the temperature of the sun. With careful mission control, the towers were dropped on the planet in order to accelerate cooling. When the planet cooled down to a safer temperature. Vanessa herself extracted Koiwa from the Phoenix core, that at the time, was only as hot as magma.

### Post-First Impact
Nation of Tsubaki was able to quickly recover thanks to efforts of N.D.S.E, however, every last of the royal family perished, leaving only Koiwa. Automatically, Koiwa became the new Queen of Tsubaki. To surpress suspicions and outrage due to First Impact, N.D.S.E had to control the media and place white lies in order to steer the possible rebellion that could stem from Koiwa becoming Queen. Afterall, she caused the First Impact, even if it wasn't intentional.

### Realm-Expansion Project
Tsubaki was choosen as the lead for the Realm-Expansion Project, or R.E.P, initiated by the Emperor Longlin and The Divine Guardian Council. At this point, Koiwa has gotten used to being a leading figure, even though she was mostly guided with the help of the Divine Guardian assigned to her nation, as well as N.D.S.E.

The purpose of this project is to further study the effects of quantum-imaginary portals, and to expand on the "Many-Worlds" theorem. As well as to aid The Divine Guardians for their research needs for the super machine.

Koiwa has no choice but to oblige.

New realm already has other nations, however, Koiwa decides to stay neutral, sticking to the "no attacking unless threatened" rule.

### Personality
Koiwa herself has a playful, fruity and sly personality, likes to flirt with women (specifically her Divine Guardian), sometimes shy and dislikes talking to outsiders. She doesn't often take things seriously and "memes" around, she prefers that way in order to hide the emotional trauma she has from the First Impact. When she is serious, it feels off putting and unpredictable. She dispises fire, or any flame related thing, such as flickering lights, kitchen stoves, lighters, even paper fires used for stage prop. She also dislikes spicy food and has a cat's tongue when it comes to hot foods.

However, her phoenix counterpart is straightforward, often deemed as rude but honest, offensivly logical and hard to debate with for her quick wits for pointing out flaws in debates.

### Abilities
- "Divine Spear" Spear of Veritas, it has the ability to morph to adjust with its surroundings. Like the Divine Spear that Longlin wields, it has the ability to open Gate of Guf, however Koiwa has not grant the ability to control that yet. Koiwa calls the spear as the "brutally honest toothpick", as it is named after a Roman Goddess of Truth. It is the ultimate weapon of Tsubaki that only Koiwa; now a Divine being, can wield and control.
- Diverse knowledge in medicine and medical, can make almost any type of medicine (given materials).
