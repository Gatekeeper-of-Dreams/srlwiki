## Faction Information

The backstory of Faction: 
After Juniper's home village was pillaged and destroyed, she set out to start a new life, alone. She found a suitable place to build her farmhouse, and set to work building it up. She now comfortably has a fenceless livestock area, flourishing crops, and a large claim of land to spread her wings over.

She is largely neutral, only reacting to direct threats to her and what little she owns. She is currently allied with The Grand Yosokoan Empire, solely for the protection they offer her against big threats she cannot handle herself, and allied with Moonlight Isle, because Mona is a good friend.
