## Faction Information

Kirameku was first established in the year 524. The first elders have made a pact to be a passive nation, as they were aware of the potential dangers that can come with magic. Not much is known right now about Kirameku's distant past.
At the peak of Kirameku, the nation stretched out as far as modern-day Kinyakumo, Sinivae, Sidelabs, and RDS, and it was home to thousands of mages. There was also a temple far to the south that's currently under protective preservation efforts and orders. But how did a nation that used to be almost as on-top-of-the-world as Yosokoa suddenly disappear, you may ask?
In 1423, a young mage by the name of Evrn was training to become the next grand elder after the current elder, Spiorad. However, he accidentally used the forbidden withering spell when trying to surprise his girlfriend, Amelia, with a field filled with her favorite flower for her 18th birthday. Even though Amelia was able to recover just fine, Evrn still had to face consequences. Normally such an act would result in an execution, but due to his position and the fact Amelia didn't face permanent injury, he was stripped of his position and banished to the nether. He was angered at the elders' decision, angry enough to accidentally create and host Coirbeachd, a demon of fire.
Coirbeachd wreaked havoc over Kirameku, forcing people to evacuate, including the new heir's family. Grand Elder Spiorad and the other elders were able to seal him away in a wizard ring.
Neighboring nations felt that Kirameku posed a threat to their safety and they responded by rushing Kirameku and eliminating its people. Most were burned at the pyre while others were tortured and enslaved to try to "work the demons and evil out of them". The elders themselves were killed trying to protect their people. The survivors who were able to flee or hide only totaled to around 20. Yosokoa was the only nearby nation to not have fought against Kirameku. Emperor Nazerious intervened when Spiorad was confirmed the last elder killed. After he laid his old friend to rest, he spread a lie that dominoed into the attacking factions going after each other until nothing remained of them.
In 2023, a young mage named Emi came across the ruins of Kirameku's capital while exploring. Curiosity consumed her enough to have a desire to rebuild what used to be there. She finds the tome Spiorad intentionally left out in hopes that someone could reseal Coirbeachd when the time came *she didn't read far enough to know that it was intended that she unseal him and reseal him since she freaked out at the idea of a demon in the area, but instructions were still followed so mission failed successfully). Naz filled her in on the information needed and the nation was miraculously able to rise from its *both figurative and literal* ashes. Emi is also allowing current settlements that are now on Kirameku's old land to stay, and she's expanded the land to some islands south of Kirameku and Sidelabs so it wouldn't just be the island that once was - and still is - Kirameku's capital.


## Top 3-5 things about your nation

This is kinda of a TLDR where you list your top 5 things that are unique or different about your nation. Be creative!

* The number of elders in the governing council grows and shrinks as the nation does. Right now the only elder is Emi, but at the nation's peak there were 13, including Grand Elder Spiorad.
* Those native to Kirameku can live up to around 200 years of age. Those in leadership roles step down at the age of 195 to allow the next generation to step up.
* The national symbol is the blue monarch butterfly, representing Kirameku's rebirth and the culture around spirits and the dead.
* As a nation of mages and with the Grand Elder being the last living mage, Kirameku is well-known for their magic.
* The national motto is "Honoring past tragedies to realize future miracles".
