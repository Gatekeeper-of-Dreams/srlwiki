## About the Grand Elder

*images coming soon*

Name: Emi

Age: 20 years

Size: 5'1 tall, 125 lbs

Birthday: December 14

Star sign: Sagittarious

Weapons of Choice: *Excalibur's Judgement* sword, *Tome of the Ancients* spellbook

Backstory: Originally an adventurous spirit, Emi was born and raised in Yosokoa after her ancestors fled there during The Great Tragedy. She became more cautious after being attacked by an endermen at a young age and eventually being captured and tortured by Coirbeachd when put on the spot to seal him away when she was still inexperienced with magic and combat, developing deep fears of endermen, fire, and being locked in a room or cell. As a leader she forces herself to develop more confidence and bravery so that she can be the grand elder the new Kirameku needs and deserves.

Extra info: As the last Kiramekan left, she has a strong personal tie to Kirameku's traditions around the dead, especially with how Kirameku had first met its end. It's not easy making an enemy of her but if you want to ensure peace with her, best not to either threaten another genocide, no matter if it's against Kirameku or another faction or people, or be insensitive about Kirameku's history and The Great Tragedy. Also even if it's something she's been working on she can still jump to conclusions too quickly or be very reactive.


## Historical figure of Importance: Spiorad

*image coming soon*

Name: Spiorad

Age *at death*: 195 years

Age *current*: 795 years

Date of birth: January 6, 1229

Date of death: October 20, 1423

Star sign: Capricorn

Backstory: Spiorad is known for being the last Grand Elder of Kirameku's golden age. He was soon to retire and give his role to his heir had tragedy not struck. When Evrn accidentally cast the withering spell, he had a heavy heart when he still had to punish him. When Coirbeachd struck, Spiorad ordered an evacuation and then he and the other elders sealed him away. When the genocide started, with no real defense, he was left to have as many people as possible evacuate to the underground bunker in the capital as attackers moved in. He felt it best to get as many records about Kirameku as possible to Yosokoa to be preserved and he was attacked on the road back. Instead of running and potentially putting his people in further danger, he allowed himself to be killed. His death marked the official end of Kirameku's golden age and the start of the era of shadows. After Emi starts working on restoring the faction, he provides some aid through advice even after death.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Evrn

*images coming soon*

Name: Evrn

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of Birth: September 11, 1405

Date of Death: September 30, 1423

Star Sign: Virgo

Backstory: Evrn was the original heir to Spiorad's position of power. He was strong and very reactive but despite his strength he also was a young man with a soft side and strong love for his girlfriend, Amelia. He'd always meet with Amelia on a hillside located in present-day Kinyakumo. On Amelia's 18th birthday, he originally had planned to surprise her by casting a spell to fill the valley below wtih alliums, her favorite flower. However, instead he accidentally used the withering spell on her. Even though she wasn't permanently hurt, he still was banished. His anger was great enough he accidentally created and got possessed by Coirbeachd. He was left unaware of what was happening since. Next thing he knew, he woke up after Coirbeachd was sealed away, laying outside of Nazcorp in May of 2023, without a physical body. He learned that his actions led to Kirameku's downfall and he did everything he could to repent. It was discovered that his spirit and Coirbeachd were tied together and so long as he was trapped in the mortal world Coirbeachd would live. Evrn was able to serve his sentence on time to reunite with Amelia during the Festival of the Dead. His tie to Coirbeachd was severed and he was able to fully pass on and Coirbeachd had lost all his power.

Extra info: Evrn, alongside Spiorad, offers Emi help after death as needed. He still has a short fuse but is usually able to keep calm.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Amelia

*image coming soon*

Name: Amelia

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of birth: September 25, 1405

Date of death: October 1423 *exact date unknown*

Star Sign: Libra

Backstory: Amelia wasn't a mage of high status in her life. That didn't stop the love she had for Grand Heir Evrn. Her kind and peaceful nature balanced perfectly enough with Evrn's explosive nature to make the relationship a healthy one. On her 18th birthday, she met with Evrn on the hill she would usually meet him on and awaited her birthday gift. One second looking over a valley, the next she was collapsed on the ground with a sharp pain in her chest. Evrn was able to counter the withering spell quickly enough for her to be fine, but he still had consequences to face. His banishment was hard for her because she knew he didn't mean to almost hurt or kill her. While she was grieving for her boyfriend, Coirbeachd attacked. She and her family were among those who evacuated during this first attack. However, she was unable to return back home. It was believed that she and her family were among the first victims of the genocide that followed.


## Faction Information

Kirameku was first established in the year 524. The first elders have made a pact to be a passive nation, as they were aware of the potential dangers that can come with magic. Not much is known right now about Kirameku's distant past.

At the peak of Kirameku, the nation stretched out as far as modern-day Kinyakumo, Sinivae, Sidelabs, and RDS, and it was home to thousands of mages. There was also a temple far to the south that's currently under protective preservation efforts and orders. But how did a nation that used to be almost as on-top-of-the-world as Yosokoa suddenly disappear, you may ask?

In 1423, a young mage by the name of Evrn was training to become the next grand elder after the current elder, Spiorad. However, he accidentally used the forbidden withering spell when trying to surprise his girlfriend, Amelia, with a field filled with her favorite flower for her 18th birthday. Even though Amelia was able to recover just fine, Evrn still had to face consequences. Normally such an act would result in an execution, but due to his position and the fact Amelia didn't face permanent injury, he was stripped of his position and banished to the nether. He was angered at the elders' decision, angry enough to accidentally create and host Coirbeachd, a demon of fire.

Coirbeachd wreaked havoc over Kirameku, forcing people to evacuate, including the new heir's family. Grand Elder Spiorad and the other elders were able to seal him away in a wizard ring.

Neighboring nations felt that Kirameku posed a threat to their safety and they responded by rushing Kirameku and eliminating its people. Most were burned at the pyre while others were tortured and enslaved to try to "work the demons and evil out of them". The elders themselves were killed trying to protect their people. The survivors who were able to flee or hide only totaled to around 20. Yosokoa was the only nearby nation to not have fought against Kirameku. Emperor Nazerious intervened when Spiorad was confirmed the last elder killed. After he laid his old friend to rest, he spread a lie that dominoed into the attacking factions going after each other until nothing remained of them.

In 2023, a young mage named Emi came across the ruins of Kirameku's capital while exploring. Curiosity consumed her enough to have a desire to rebuild what used to be there. She finds the tome Spiorad intentionally left out in hopes that someone could reseal Coirbeachd when the time came *she didn't read far enough to know that it was intended that she unseal him and reseal him since she freaked out at the idea of a demon in the area, but instructions were still followed so mission failed successfully). Naz filled her in on the information needed and the nation was miraculously able to rise from its *both figurative and literal* ashes. Emi is also allowing current settlements that are now on Kirameku's old land to stay, and she's expanded the land to some islands south of Kirameku and Sidelabs so it wouldn't just be the island that once was - and still is - Kirameku's capital.

* The national symbol is the blue monarch butterfly, representing Kirameku's rebirth and the culture around spirits and the dead.
* As a nation of mages and with the Grand Elder being the last living mage, Kirameku is well-known for their magic.
