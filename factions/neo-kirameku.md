## Faction Information

The nation of Kirameku was originally started in the year 524. The first elder or group of elders had decided it best to avoid conflict as much as possible, knowing how dangerous magic could be. This oath for peace is one of the longest-lasting things in this kingdom, still being kept by Emi to this day. Much is still currently unknown about this most distant past. 
In its peak, Kirameku stretched as far as present-day Kinyakumo, Sinivae, Sidelabs, and RDS. Today Kirameku only occupies the island that used to just be its capital as well as some islands south of it. Emi is alright with the nations that now occupy the land that used to belong to Kirameku to keep the land. There's also a temple far to the south that's kept preserved and off-limits.
How did a nation that used to be almost as on-top-of-the-world as Yosokoa suddenly disappear you may ask?
In 1423, a young mage by the name of Evrn was training up to be the next grand elder. He accidentally used the forbidden withering spell when he was trying to fill a field with flowers for his girlfriend's 18th birthday. Although she was able to recover just fine, Evrn still had to face consequences. Normally the punishment for the crime is death but due to his high position and trust and little to no permanent harm actually coming to the victim, he was only stripped of his position and banished to the nether. His resulting anger was so great he accidentally created and hosted Coirbeachd, a demon of fire.
Coirbeachd wreaked havoc over Kirameku, forcing people to evacuate to neighboring nations. The new heir to the title of grand elder also had to flee. Grand Elder Spiorad and the other elders were able to seal Coirbeachd away in a wizard ring.
Neighboring kingdoms felt that Kirameku posed a threat to their safety and they responded by rushing Kirameku and eliminating its people. Most were burned at the pyre while others were tortured and enslaved to try to "work the demons and evil out of them". The elders themselves were killed trying to protect their people. The survivors totaled up to 20-50 people who were able to flee or hide. Yosokoa was the only nearby faction to not go against Kirameku. The Emperor, Nazerious, intervened when Spiorad was killed. After laying his friend to rest, he spread a lie that dominoed into the attacking factions going after each other until nothing remained of them.
In 2023, a young mage named Emi came across the ruins of the capital while out exploring. Her curiosity starts to snowball into wanting to build this nation back up. She finds the tome Spiorad intentionally left out in hopes someone could reseal Coirbeachd when the time came to. Nazerious filled her in on the information she needed in order to make this project take off and soon, Kirameku had miraculously risen from its *figurative and literal* ashes.


## Top 3-5 things about your nation

This is kinda of a TLDR where you list your top 5 things that are unique or different about your nation. Be creative!

* The number of members in the Elder's council grows and shrinks as the nation does. Right now it's just Emi, but at the nation's peak there were 13 elders, including Spiorad himself!
* The national symbol is a blue monarch butterfly, referencing the nation's rebirth and the culture around the past and the people that lived in this nation long ago.
* The people native to Kirameku can live around 200 years. Those in leadership positions step down at the age of 195 to allow the next generation to step up.
* As a nation of mages and the current leader being the last living mage herself, Kirameku is most well known for its magic.
* National motto: "Honoring yesterday's tragedies to realize tomorrow's miracles"
