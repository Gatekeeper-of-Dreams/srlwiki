## About the Grand Elder

*images coming soon*

Name: Emi

Age: 20 years

Size: 5'1 tall, 125 lbs

Birthday: December 14

Star sign: Sagittarious

Weapons of Choice: *Excalibur's Judgement* sword, *Tome of the Ancients* spellbook

Backstory: Originally an adventurous spirit, Emi was born and raised in Yosokoa after her ancestors fled there during The Great Tragedy. She became more cautious after being attacked by an endermen at a young age and eventually being captured and tortured by Coirbeachd when put on the spot to seal him away when she was still inexperienced with magic and combat, developing deep fears of endermen, fire, and being locked in a room or cell. As a leader she forces herself to develop more confidence and bravery so that she can be the grand elder the new Kirameku needs and deserves.

Extra info: As the last Kiramekan left, she has a strong personal tie to Kirameku's traditions around the dead, especially with how Kirameku had first met its end. It's not easy making an enemy of her but if you want to ensure peace with her, best not to either threaten Kirameku or be rude towards her or her family (she especially gets mad when called a demon or told "Spiorad wasn't a good leader anyway". Also even if it's something she's been working on she can still jump to conclusions too quickly or be very reactive.


## The Second Elder

*images coming soon*

Name: Saph

Age: 21 years

Size: 5'7 tall, 140 lbs

Birthday: September 21

Star Sign: Libra

Weapon of choice: Iron sword

Backstory: A wandering historian. He enjoys traveling the world, getting to know other people, and learning about all the diverse histories and cultures. He also isn't afraid to dive into all history - even the bad and ugly side of the world's nature. 
He was travelling through the area near the western nations when Kinyakumo and Yosokoa closed their borders. Unable to visit either nation, he made Kirameku his next stop. After learning of its history, he finds Emi's mission an admirable feat and decided that he would help. He's got no experience of a world leader but he knows enough from speaking with other world leaders and historians to give tips based on what worked for some nations and what hasn't worked for other nations and then match them with Emi's convictions.

Extra Info: He doesn't use magic nor has the ability to. He also isn't of Kiramekan descent. Despite all that, he's trusted enough to be the second elder of Kirameku.


## Historical figure of Importance: Spiorad

*image coming soon*

Name: Spiorad

Age *at death*: 194 years

Age *current*: 795 years

Date of birth: January 6, 1229

Date of death: October 20, 1423

Star sign: Capricorn

Backstory: Spiorad is known for being the last Grand Elder of Kirameku's golden age. He was soon to retire and give his role to his heir had tragedy not struck. When Evrn accidentally cast the withering spell, he had a heavy heart when he still had to punish him. When Coirbeachd struck, Spiorad ordered an evacuation and then he and the other elders sealed him away. When the genocide started, with no real defense, he was left to have as many people as possible evacuate to the underground bunker in the capital as attackers moved in. He felt it best to get as many records about Kirameku as possible to Yosokoa to be preserved and he was attacked on the road back. Instead of running and potentially putting his people in further danger, he allowed himself to be killed. His death marked the official end of Kirameku's golden age and the start of the era of shadows. After Emi starts working on restoring the faction, he provides some aid through advice even after death.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Evrn

Name: Evrn

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of Birth: September 11, 1405

Date of Death: September 30, 1423

Star Sign: Virgo

Backstory: Evrn was the original heir to Spiorad's position of power. He was strong and very reactive but despite his strength he also was a young man with a soft side and strong love for his girlfriend, Amelia. He'd always meet with Amelia on a hillside located in present-day Kinyakumo. On Amelia's 18th birthday, he originally had planned to surprise her by casting a spell to fill the valley below wtih alliums, her favorite flower. However, instead he accidentally used the withering spell on her. Even though she wasn't permanently hurt, he still was banished. His anger was great enough he accidentally created and got possessed by Coirbeachd. He was left unaware of what was happening since. Next thing he knew, he woke up after Coirbeachd was sealed away, laying outside of Nazcorp in May of 2023, without a physical body. He learned that his actions led to Kirameku's downfall and he did everything he could to repent. It was discovered that his spirit and Coirbeachd were tied together and so long as he was trapped in the mortal world Coirbeachd would live. Evrn was able to serve his sentence on time to reunite with Amelia during the Festival of the Dead. His tie to Coirbeachd was severed and he was able to fully pass on and Coirbeachd had lost all his power.

Extra info: Evrn, alongside Spiorad, offers Emi help after death as needed. He still has a short fuse but is usually able to keep calm.


## Historical Figure of Importance: Amelia

*image coming soon*

Name: Amelia

Age *at death*: 18

Age *current*: 618

Date of birth: September 25, 1405

Date of death: October 1423 *exact date unknown*

Star Sign: Libra

Backstory: Amelia wasn't a mage of high status in her life. That didn't stop the love she had for Grand Heir Evrn. Her kind and peaceful nature balanced perfectly enough with Evrn's explosive nature to make the relationship a healthy one. On her 18th birthday, she met with Evrn on the hill she would usually meet him on and awaited her birthday gift. One second looking over a valley, the next she was collapsed on the ground with a sharp pain in her chest. Evrn was able to counter the withering spell quickly enough for her to be fine, but he still had consequences to face. His banishment was hard for her because she knew he didn't mean to almost hurt or kill her. While she was grieving for her boyfriend, Coirbeachd attacked. She and her family were among those who evacuated during this first attack. However, she was unable to return back home. It was believed that she and her family were among the first victims of the genocide that followed.


## History

Kirameku was first established 1500 years before present day. During that time, war had been raging among the multiple civilizations – tribes, villages, cities, and nations alike - of humans that lived in modern-day Kinyakumo, Kirameku, international territory, and RDS over the issues around magic. Non-magics perceived magic users as a threat that needed to be eliminated, while magic users were fighting in the name of self-defense, some even fighting because they feel superior to non-magics. There were also cultural differences with non-magics not having a good understanding and even being weirded out by magical culture and magic users feeling like the non-magics’ reasons for war are sinful and that karma will be coming back for them.

The people that started Kirameku are from a small hamlet off the coast west of the main island. They found themselves on the island after the hamlet got attacked in the middle of the war. One of the four decided that he’s had enough with the war and that he was going to make a nation meant to be a sanctuary from war, a nation fighting for peace through peace. Everyone else thought he was insane. It had been felt unanimously that any hope of peace between magical humans and non-magical humans was long gone. He asserted that he as going to try anyway – so in short the reason Kirameku even exists is because someone wanted to prove a point.

Its capital lies on the island immediately west of spawn and the nation has grown and shrunk from there. In the nation’s peak, it’s stretched out as far as present-day Kinyakumo, Sinivae, and RDS. Today, Kirameku only occupies the capital island and some islands to the south of Sidelabs, allowing the nations that now occupy the land that used to belong to Kirameku to keep the land. There’s also a temple far to the south that’s kept under protection.

As for how leadership works, there’s one main leader, the grand elder, who is the head and main representative of the nation. The other elders act as an extension of the grand elder and help divide up the responsibilities. In example, Kirameku in its glory days had 13 districts and 13 elders if you count the Grand Elder and the capital. Each elder was assigned a district and focused on the area’s on local issues and trade. Nowadays, Emi is over the southern island as well as culture and history preservation, magical matters, and defense while Saph is over the northern island as well as international relations and historical research and restoration.

But how did a nation that used to be almost as on top of the world as Yosokoa suddenly disappear, you may ask?


## The Great Tragedy

600 years before present day, the young mage training up to be the next grand elder, Evrn, accidentally used the forbidden withering spell when trying to surprise his girlfriend, Amelia, for her 18th birthday. Although Amelia was able to recover just fine, Evrn still had to face consequences. He was stripped of his future power and banished to the nether. He was angry, but angered enough to accidentally create and host Coirbeachd, a fire demon.

Coirbeachd wreaked havoc over Kirameku, forcing people to evacuate to neighboring nations, including the person who’s taken Evrn’s position. Grand Elder Spiorad and the other elders were able to seal him away in a wizard ring.

Neighboring kingdoms felt that Kirameku posed a threat to their safety and they responded by rushing Kirameku and eliminating its people. Most were burned at the pyre while others were tortured and enslaved to try to “work the demons and evil out of them”. The elders themselves were killed trying to protect their people. The survivors totaled up to 20 people at most who were able to flee or hide. Yosokoa was the only nearby faction to not go against Kirameku. Emperor Naz intervened when his friend, Spiorad, was killed and he spread a lie or two that dominoed into the factions attacking Kirameku going after each other until there was nothing left.

A year ago now, a young Emi came across Kirameku’s capital ruins and let her curiosity run rampant to the point she wanted to build the area back up. She finds the tome Spiorad intentionally left out that would allow her to unseal Coirbeachd and reseal him in a stronger seal, which she didn’t read that far since she freaked out about a demon being in the area, but instructions were still followed so mission failed successfully. Naz filled her in on the information on Kirameku that she needed to know in order to go forward in continuing the nation’s history.

Nowadays, Emi leads Kirameku with some extra help from a friend, Saph. Kirameku’s main focus is establishing a peaceful place where magic users and non-magics can peacefully coexist.
