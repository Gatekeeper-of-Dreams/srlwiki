## AGE OF THE CHIEFDOM
Yosokoa as it is today is vastly different from the way it has been in the past. Although it is currently an Empire, it was not always this way. Hundreds of thousands of years before the current date, the Tribe of Ulanovsk was founded by a man named Eldris. This man is considered as the father of the Yosokoan Empire. The Tribe of Ulanovsk was formed when the overworld was not even a thought yet. The Great Unknown, as its called, is the being that created the known universe, and He created the plane of existance that Ulanovsk was founded. Following Eldris came Corban and Daikuno as the 2nd and 3rd Chiefs of the Tribe of Ulanovsk. 

## AGE OF THE KINGDOM OF YOSOKOA
After Daikuno died, Zandemir took control of the tribe, but there was new peoples discovered, in total, 6 more tribes had been discovered in the known regions of the End known as the Nova. The tribes were as follows:
- Ulanovsk (Royal tribe, where all leaders come from)
- Volyn
- Orenburg
- Kherson
- Altai
- Karelia
- Masovia

Zandemir was known for his foreign relations, and so, with much persuasion and consultations, united the 7 tribes under 1 kingdom. Instead of calling the Kingdom, Ulanovsk, they decided to go with a different word from the language they shared. The name chosen was Yosokoa (Yo-soh-koah) which means "many in one" representing the unity of 7 tribes. Because of this unification. the neighboring Kingdom of Nevrax was immediatley angered by the prosperity of Yosokoa and plunged head first into the War of the Kingdoms. Zandemir was killed in battle during the final years of the war. Because of his death, the Yosokoan soldiers made a final charge while beseiging Nevrax's capitol, Anthria. The Siege of Antria was the last battle as the Yosokoan soldiers killed the King of Nevrax and the kingdom fell to the hands of Yosokoa. After peace was negotiated, the people of Ulanovsk decided that Nanokadi should succeed Zandemir as the 2nd king. Nanokadi reigned for 25,000 Earth Years before passing on and Nazerious was chosen as the 3rd King.

## DOWNFALL OF THE HOMELAND
Nazerious took the throne in a time of termoil. Nanokadi was killed by a group known as the Resurgence, looking to bring Yosokoa to its knees. At the top of this terrorist group was an alchemist by the name of Saturnis. He was a master in the mystical arts and caused one of the two most feared days in Yosokoan history. Saturnis used a forbidden ritual and he used the power to slay 3/4ths of the Yosokoan Population. Nazerious fought back but moments before Saturnis was killed, a final ritual was said. He cursed the current and all future generations to never be able to return to the homeland, or Nova, for all of eternity. But Nazerious stabbed Saturnis before it was 100% complete meaning that there was a short window where the Yosokoan peoples could return for a visit, usually lasting between 24-72 hours. Yosokoa was thrown into the Overworld, in a unfamiliar place, left to create a new society all on their own. Nazerious spent many decades forming the country and decided to transition the Kingdom to a republic

## AGE OF THE REPUBLIC OF YOSOKOA
The age of the Republic was rather short, about 200 years prior to the present day, Nazerious made the nation into a republic, a rather unpopular move with the people. It resulted in inadequate governing so Nazerious decided to end the trivial matters and reform the nation into what its supposed to be.

## RISE OF THE EMPIRE
Nazerious, assuming the role of Emperor, formed Yosokoa into the Grand Yosokoan Empire. Instead of him being the sole being responsible for everything, Nazerious divided tasks into Imperial Offices to make sure that the operations of the nation ran smoothly. This is what he broke the nation into:
- Imperial Office of the Interior: Responsible for national parks and upkeep of the lands.
- Imperial Office of the Homeland: Responsible for the protection of all government and important sites throughout Yosokoa and its outside claims. Officers are stationed at embassies to protect the Imperial Ambassadors.
- Imperial Office of the Military: Responsible for the 3 branches of the military, the Army, Navy and Air Force.
- Imperial Office of Foreign Relations: Responsible for the operations of Embassies and relaying information partaining to the United Factions and the Western Alliance
- Imperial Office of Temple Affairs: Responsible for the upkeep of the Great Yosokoan Temple which is soon to be reformed into the Temple Museum due to the *Storm Incident of 2023*
- Imperial Office of Magical Beings: Responsible for researching how magic effects the landscape of Yosokoa, as well as The Storm and its impact on Yosokoa and the world.

Yosokoa is governed completley by the Emperor, although his tasks are divided among Imperial Offices. Emperor Naz is married to a woman named Tamayo, who became the Empress. Along with the Emperor and Empress, Naz and Tamayo had a biological son named Arceus. Prince Arceus now is the lead of the Imperial office of the Military, and is the heir to the Yosokoan Throne. Alongside Arceus, Naz and Tamayo had an adopted daughter, Emi. The Grand Elder of Kirameku was first dropped at the doorstep of the palace when Emi was only a few months old. Naz and Tamayo took her in, raised her and made her the Princess of Yosokoa. By the age of 18, Emi took on a dual citizenship and decided to govern Kirameku as the first Grand Elder in many centuries. Nowadays, Princess Emi still gives her input on some Yosokoan matters but tends to leave the governing to the Emperor.


## YOSOKOA IN THE MODERN AGE

Nazerious' newest endeavor, NazCorp is a military company focused on the production of war technology and general tech advancements that are shipped out to nations who request it.
