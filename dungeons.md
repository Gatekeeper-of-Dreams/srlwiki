# Dungeons

Here on the server we have these limited time events called "Dungeons". They are staff run (for now, trying to make it automated in the future) events that have our players explore new, hand crafted areas not on the normal world. Dungeons are dangerous and as such require multiple players to defeat. These events will be posted in #dungeon-runs on the [discord](https://discord.gg/rWW7ZKu).&#x20;

Each dungeon has a list of requirements to ensure success. Please refer to the following table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="140">Dungeon</th><th width="179">Minimum Players</th><th width="172">Maximum Players</th><th width="109">Ruleset</th><th>Dungeon Gold</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>King Slime</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Legacy</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Eternal Globe</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Legacy</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Undead Tower</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Legacy</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mythcrest City</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>Legacy</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Rubendum's Gauntlet</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>Current</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Magelock</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>Current</td><td>13</td></tr></tbody></table>

### General Dungeon Ruleset.

All dungeons runners are required to obey and agree to the following rules

* By default, you get one life in the dungeon. If you die, you forfit all items gained in the dungeon and will return home empty handed. If you buy services from the dungeon shop before the dungeon, this will of course apply. Not all dungeons have dungeon shops, so choose wisely.
* You agree to not purposely cheese the map. If you find something that is not intended to be there, notify a DM
* You agree to be a good teammate. Remember, everyone only has one life, and once they die there gone, so it's in your best interest to keep everyone alive.
* You agree to not purposely throw off the storyline. Let it play out and get into it if you want to have a good playthrough.

### Legacy Dungeon Ruleset

Legacy dungeons are older dungeons created before the SRL rebrand. These dungeons were created by Side, Glitch, and Naz. The storyline in these dungeon is **NOT** cannon and does not affect the overall lore of the server. The rules for these dungeons are the following

* Obey posted signage. (Some items are banned based on the dungeon, which will be listed before entering the dungeon)
* Other than banned items, you are allowed to bring anything in from creative mode that you'd like.
* Key requirements are waived. You can do any dungeon without have the prior dungeons key.
* Dungeon Gold will be awarded based on the table above. The numbers here are the truth, ignore what you see in the dungeons. You will notice that the amount of dungeon gold is higher if you run current dungeons, this is by design
* You will need to follow the min/max players.
* All other dungeon rules apply

### Current Dungeon Ruleset

Current dungeons are made from 2023 onward and **CAN** pertian to overall server lore. (For example Rubendum's Gauntlet was a lore created dungeon. You can read more about that [here](lore-recap.md#rubendum).) These dungeons are created by any server member that has a good enough idea. Typically redstone and techinical stuff is handled by Side, but can be handled by the member if they feel confident with our dungeon making tools. The rules for current dungeons are the following

* Obey posted signage. (Some items are banned based on the dungeon, which will be listed before entering the dungeon)
* Depending on the dungeon, you will either be granted a random inventory upon entry, or go in with nothing but what you find in the dungeon.
  * Anyone found smuggling in items may be kicked or banned from the server.
* Key Requirements are enforced. You will be required to have the required key before entering. If you don't have the required key, you can use Key Fusion at the dungeon hub before entering to gain a key. Read more about that [here](dungeons.md#key-fusion).
* Dungeon gold will be awarded based on the table above. The signs in game should match, but if not, the wiki is the correct one. You will notice the amount of gold you get is higher for current dungeons. This is by design.

### Dungeon Gold

Dungeon gold is the main currency you get from completing dungeons. On successful completion of the dungeon, you will get that dungeons key, and x amount of dungeon gold listed in the above table. This resource cannot be traded amongst members, it can only be used at SideShops, Key Fusion, or Dungeon Shops, all which are located before dungeons. These merchants will allow you to exchange dungeon gold for perks in dungeons, such as more lives and not losing items on death. Each shop will have there stock listed before entry, so we encourage you to take a look

### Key Fusion

In the dungeon hub, there will be a SideShop which can do something called Key Fusion. You can turn any key you recieve into dungeon gold.  Then you can use dungeon gold to buy any key available, **without** running that dungeon. Here is the breakdown of every dungeon and how to get it's key

| Dungeon             | Dismantled dungeon gold | Forging Dungeon Gold |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| King Slime          | 5                       | Free Dungeon         |
| Eternal Globe       | 8                       | Free Dungeon         |
| Undead Tower        | 5                       | Free Dungeon         |
| Mythcrest City      | 10                      | Free Dungeon         |
| Rubendum's Gauntlet | 15                      | 10DG                 |
| Magelock            | 13                      | 10DG                 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, you do **not** need keys for legacy dungeons, so you don't have the abilty to forge keys for legacy dungeons.
{% endhint %}

Currently, we don't have any current dungeons that require keys, so this system won't be in affect, but Starting with Eternal Globe 2, this will be in affect.&#x20;
