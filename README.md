## How to edit this wiki.

1. Open up either [https://sidel.ink/wiki](https://sidel.ink/wiki) and click the "Edit" text (or visit [https://sidel.ink/editwiki](https://editwiki) to get here directly)
2. Sign into your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can make one here. It's free.
3. Either click on the Add File button or click on the document you want to edit.
4. Click the pen in the upper right (or select `e` on your keyboard)
5. Make your edit using the markdown syntax (cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Most of these are just like Discord with added benefits.
6. Click on commit or make a pull request. (Both of these do the same things, but commit is if you have direct access and pull requests are if you don't. Execs and admins can get commit access after creating your account by DMing me.)
7. Done! If you made a Pull request (PR) I usually will approve those within 24 hours.
